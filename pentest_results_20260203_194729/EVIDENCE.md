## Why We Think This

Each claim in this analysis is derived from multiple evidence sources.
The confidence scores reflect the strength and consistency of the evidence.

**Legend**:

- **d (disbelief)**: Degree of belief the claim is false
- **u (uncertainty)**: Degree of uncertainty
- **P**: Expected probability (b + a*u)
